    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans:The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enhance code organization, reusability, and maintainability."

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, an object is an instance of a class, encapsulating data and behavior associated with that class. Objects are the building blocks of object-oriented programming and can represent real-world entities or abstract concepts."

    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure that encapsulates attributes and methods, providing a template for creating instances (objects) with shared characteristics and behavior."

    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "Ans:Attributes in a class are variables that store data, representing the characteristics of objects created from the class. Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that the objects can perform. Attributes and methods together encapsulate the state and behavior of objects in object-oriented programming."

    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "Ans:Class variables in Python are shared among all instances of a class and are defined outside of any method in the class. They are accessed using the class name. Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class and are defined within methods using the `self` keyword. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables."

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "Ans:The `self` parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It allows methods to access and modify attributes of the instance. When calling a method on an object, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method, conventionally named `self`."
